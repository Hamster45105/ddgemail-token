This is a web application that will retrieve your duck.com email API key. It's built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and deployed with Vercel.

Your API token is needed for Bitwarden, [Send From Duck](https://hamster45105.github.io/DuckAddressSend/) etc...

## Usage

1. Enter your username and click "Next".
2. Enter the OTP and click "Get Token".
3. Your API key will be displayed on the screen.

Note: Don't spam getting a token for the same user because the DuckDuckGo service will block you and you won't be able to make any more requests for a while

# Third Party Services
To prevent spam and bots, the website uses Google's reCatpcha. Here are their [terms of service](https://policies.google.com/terms) and [privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

It also uses Vercel's web analytics.

No data is stored by the server, you can check the source code to see.
